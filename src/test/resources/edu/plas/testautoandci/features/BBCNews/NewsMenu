Feature: NewsMenu

  In order to see news from different categories
  As a user
  I want to be able to navigate through a menu of categories

  Scenario: NewsCategories
    Given I am on the BBC News website
    Then I see menu items:
      | Home                 |
      | Video                |
      | World                |
